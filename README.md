# Stat545A MiniDataAnalysis: Dilan Sunthareswaran

## Introduction 
Welcome to Dilan's STAT545A Mini Data Analysis Milestones 1 & 2. In both milestones we used techniques taught in STAT545A to perform multiple tasks which visualized and summarized data in various approaches. For this project, we examined the `apt_buildings` dataset. We use multiple packages within this repository like `dplyr` and `tidyverse`. The other packages used can be found within the source codes. 

## Repository Format
The main directory has 3 folders, one for each milestone and an output folder which contains csv files and model outputs. Within each milestone folder contains a seperate `README` file which explains what is in the respective folder.
